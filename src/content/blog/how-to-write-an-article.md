This is a guide for potential authors on how to write articles for CanSource. CanSource articles can
be written by anyone, but need to be professionally written and pertain to electronics, software, or
design. Every article published on CanSource goes through the process outlined in this document, and
is reviewed by a set of authorised reviewers to make sure it is of sufficient quality for 
publishing.

The steps for publishing an article are as follows:

 1. [Branch or fork the website repository.](#starting-a-branch)
    * Where to put your files.
 2. [Write your article.](#writing-an-article)
    * Syntax and previewing.
    * Add figures, tables, and references.
    * Meet the writing standards.
    * Add your author profile.
 3. [Submit for review.](#review-process)
    * The reviewers.
    * Making amendments.
 4. [Publish!](#publishing)
    * Making amendments (after release).
    * Removing articles.

The following sections elaborate on each of these steps.


<h3 id="starting-a-branch">Starting a Branch</h3>

To start writing an article you will need to create a branch of the repository. We ask that you do
so by making a fork of the repository on your GitHub account. (If you have been granted sufficient
access to the CanSource website repository you may make a branch on there. If you do, please make
sure to prefix your branch with `article/` to differentiate it from feature branches.)

To create your branch, fork the [CanSource website repository](https://github.com/CanSource/website).
This can be done by visiting the CanSource website repository on GitHub and clicking the fork button
at the top right. This will create a personal copy of the repository for you to work in. When you
are finished writing your article you will be able to make a pull request with your forked 
repository as apart of the [submission process](#review-process).

To learn more about forks, a good starting point is [GitHub's documentation about them](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo).

This is still under development, sorry! For now, just make sure that your name is included as apart
of the authors section in the header of your article.

<h4>Amendments</h4>


<h3 id="publishing">Publishing</h3>

Once an article has passed review with all necessary amendments made, it's fit for publishing! 
Congratulations! As soon as it can be published, it will be freely and publicly available on the
CanSource website.

We understand that sometimes things are published with errors and we provide mechanisms for
correcting these. The following sub-sections address the processes for amending and removing
published articles.

<h4>Amendments</h4>

<h4>Removal</h4>

Articles can be removed from the CanSource website on request from the author or maintainers.
Removal will happen as soon as is feasible, and the maintainers are responsible to make sure the
removal is timely (e.g. within a week of the request). This may not be possible in extreme cases.
To request a removal please use the issue tracker on the website repository.

It is worth noting that while the article will be removed from the published website, it may still
exist in the version history of the website published on the (publicly accessible) git repository.
As always, it is advisable to be certain of what you publish online before you publish it so that
removals are not necessary except in rare circumstances.
